# Basic-Machine-Learning-Project
# OVERVIEW AND INSPIRATION 
+ The “Regression with a crab age dataset” project is motivated by a crucial challenge in the fields of biology and aquaculture: estimating the age of crabs based on their biological characteristics. This is significant because assessing the age of crabs can provide important information about their development cycle and reproductive capability, thereby aiding in the effective management of aquatic resources.
+ A little exception here is that this practice helps me gain a better insight into more coding algorithms of Machine Learning. 
# DATASET 
+ The dataset I collected is from Kaggle.
